I'll let you in on a little secret. Web design makes me nervous. 

Yes, Nervous. But not in the way in which you might think. I love design, especially functional design. I enjoy talking with end users and subject matter experts to understand requirements and use cases. It's like unravelling the pages of a great book, except that you're the one writing the book as you learn the story.

There's the mystery of finding the right questions to ask as I work my way through the words and the weeds to discover the real reasons why things are done a certain way.

It's understanding the existing limitations that cause certain situations, the permanent workarounds that become 'how it's always been done', the governing legislation and policies that are so complex that even teams of lawyers struggle to understand their intentions. And then there are the assumptions that are so ingrained in the underlying culture of an organisation that they never need to be put into words, you just feel it.

## Below the Surface
When done right, diving below the surface of an enterprise organisation is extremely mentally exhausting. 

You need to ask the right questions in a way that aligns with the culture of the organisation. You need to process and absorb the answers, and weed through the information in seconds. 

In these few seconds, you have to identify patterns, make quick judgements about the amount of information you have, create a mental map of what you know and don't know, and balance out the time you have, the avenues you can explore, the background of the people in the room, and the mood. 

To find the best possible thing that you can say or do next to help you get one step closer to the goal. Or at least, what you think is the goal, because you have to work through the ambiguity and figure that out too, and then help everyone else understand it.  

All this, whilst usually standing in front of a whiteboard with a marker that's running out, and a room full of people who have better things to do.  

## A.C.T

Over the years, I've learnt that there are a few key things that I needed to have, in order to get the most out of these situations: 
- A genuine interest or curiosity about the subject matter 
- Credibility
- Trust 

These things are all more or less related. The more I did something, the more experience I got, and the more comfortable I felt. I made a conscious effort to not make things up. If I didn't know something, I said so, and took an action to find out. If I said that I'd do something, I made sure it got done. I like to think that I didn't make empty promises.

For my team, these, and my other design principles were non-negotiable. 

It was very rare for me to peer-review a 200-300 page design document and not have comments for every single page. I set the bar high, and my design team rose to the challenge. It became a personal victory for the team to create the highest quality designs. And once someone picks up the habit of quality, everything they do, and everything that happens down the line becomes faster.

I also discovered that I didn't believe in self-confidence. No 'fake it till you make it' scenarios. In my mind, there is no such thing. You do. You learn. Rinse. Repeat. 

You don't fake it. You never fake it. Because once you do, you lose respect, you think you're better, and you're not - you're fake. Fake and false expectations don't build trust. If you don't believe me, just wait until the other person finds out, and they will.

### Relax
You can measure your interest in one subject compared to another (curiosity). You can measure how much someone believes what you say (credibility), and how much they believe you will do what you say (trust). 

You can't measure self-confidence. You can, however, measure your heart rate. I found that the more relaxed and alert I was, the better sub-second decisions I made. Perhaps it's about self-credibility, and self-trust. And when you're working 100+ hours a week, it's also about sleep.

Everyone should have a set of beliefs. Mine helped me translate what I learnt into real options, tangible solutions, and led to solving real problems. So much so, that often I knew more about the organisations I was working with, than most of their own employees and senior management.

## Limitations

The first part of design is about discovery and possibilities. This phase of discovery, analysis, or whatever you want to call it, is all about learning, absorbing, and insight. 

In an enterprise project, or perhaps any large project, solving problems with the current technology on the market today, is about limitations. The word 'limitations', has a negative connotation, and in design, it seeketh to take away. 

There are limitations in budget, time, scope, resources (people), skills, the technology that can be used, legacy systems that need to be supported, vendor agreements, location of servers etc etc.  

If you don't like to call them limitations, call them opportunities, but either way, the limitations are set by the powers-that-be, and the technology just needs to somehow fit into it. It has to, because organisations grow organically, and suddenly they have thousands of spreadsheets and database systems, and more MS Access databases with sensitive information in it than you want to know about.


## Web design

When it comes to web design, the limitations are still there. There are other challenges of course, such as the technology itself, and being able to learn it quickly, as it continues to change and adapt.

As with any element of thoughtful design, the most important work happens before any wireframes are created, and before any design patterns are thought through.

When I first made the leap from enterprise design to web design, it wasn't because I thought it was cool, or that it was something I thought I should do. It was because someone I know well, let's call him Adam, asked me to help him solve a problem.

### A problem to solve

Adam ran a successful manufacturing operation in Melbourne, and other than his accounting software, everything else was managed using paper. The idea was that I'd meet with him, and see if I could offer any suggestions for improving or redesigning his processes. More as a favour for a friend than anything else.

I spent a couple of hours with Adam in one of his warehouses, walking around as he showed me through the processes, and the key steps that went into running his daily business operations. 

As we were walking around, Adam mentioned that what he'd really like was some kind of system to manage his warehouse orders, production tickets, dispatch schedule, delivery, the whole shebang. He'd been searching around for something for a while, and couldn't find what he wanted. Then he asked if I could build something for him. 

I told Adam, that I could help with design and architecture, but I didn't build stuff. I dabbled and prototyped with Oracle products, but hadn't actually built any consumer products before. I didn't even know where to start.

Adam insisted that he would be really grateful if I just gave it a shot, even if all I could do was pull together a spreadsheet with some of the process re-design ideas I had. 

There is a look that people get when they really need your help. When they feel like you're the only option they trust. When they believe in you, even more than you do. It makes you want to try. 

I went home that day, and did some research on the latest trends in web design. I saw terms like Yeoman, Bower, Grunt, Angular, Node. I leant, experimented, and hit one error after another as I absorbed everything I could. 

After work and on the weekends, I slowly started to make something. There were times that I spent days working through some errors, just searching for examples that would give me a breakthrough. I didn't understand the code well enough, I didn't know what was possible or not, but I could pick up patterns, and I could apply logical thought processes. Within a month I had deployed the first iteration of Adam's new system (we named it Tracker). He was stoked, and I had made my first foray into web design and development.

## Startup

Not long after that, I left my job as a design lead/solution architect, and started a new company. I sometimes describe a startup like 'dating', and an enterprise organisation as 'a long term relationship'. In a startup, product-market fit is like finding the elusive Mr. Right. 

In those early months, I leaned heavily on blog posts and youtube videos. And, as a way to give back, I created http://www.bossable.com where I could post about web design and development with free videos. 

I went back to create something that I wish had been available to me when I was starting out. 

My first series was the 30 Day MEAN Stack challenge, where I posted a video every day for 30 days to take beginners through the process of developing their first app using MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS, as part of the MEAN Stack. 

But, I digress, I started this post by mentioning that web design makes me nervous, so I probably should get back to that point. 

Web design makes me nervous because with the right tools, the speed of execution is insane. 

It makes me nervous because there are no boundaries to access fully featured products and services online. 

It makes me nervous because the possibilities of introducing this level of speed in the right way, into a large enterprise will change everything. 

It makes me nervous because if I can do it, so can you.
